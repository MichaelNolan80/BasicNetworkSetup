# BasicNetworkSetup
Basic Network Set up with a number of routers. It has a number of endpoints that have RADIUS authentication.

This is a common task for network engineers and requires a blend of theoretical knowledge and hands-on skills.

1. Foundational Networking Knowledge

TCP/IP Model: 
A deep understanding of how data moves across networks, including IP addressing, subnetting, routing protocols (like OSPF or BGP), and network layers.
Routing Concepts: Familiarity with static routing, dynamic routing, routing tables, and how routers make forwarding decisions.
Network Security: Basic understanding of firewalls, access lists, VPNs, and security best practices.
2. Router Configuration Skills

Command-Line Interface (CLI):
Proficiency in using the CLI to configure and manage routers (Cisco IOS, Junos, etc.).
Router Configuration: Ability to set up interfaces, configure IP addresses, enable routing protocols, create VLANs, and implement access lists.
Troubleshooting: Skills to diagnose and resolve network issues, analyze logs, and use network monitoring tools.
3. RADIUS Server Setup and Configuration

RADIUS Protocol:
Understanding of how RADIUS works for authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA).
RADIUS Server Installation: Ability to install and configure a RADIUS server (FreeRADIUS, Cisco ACS, etc.).
User Management: Setting up user accounts, assigning attributes, and managing access policies on the RADIUS server.
4. Integration of Routers and RADIUS

Authentication Configuration:
Configuring routers to use the RADIUS server for user authentication (e.g., for SSH access, VPN connections, or wireless network access).
Attribute Mapping: Defining how attributes from the RADIUS server are used to grant access or apply policies on the routers.
Testing and Verification: Thoroughly testing the integration to ensure that users can authenticate successfully and receive the correct network access.
5. Additional Skills

Documentation: 
Ability to document the network configuration, including router settings, RADIUS server details, and user access policies.
Scripting: Basic scripting skills (e.g., Python) can be helpful for automating tasks or managing multiple routers.
Problem-Solving: Strong analytical and problem-solving skills to troubleshoot complex network issues.
To further enhance your explanation, you could provide specific examples:

Router Configuration: 
Show a snippet of code for configuring a router interface or setting up a routing protocol.
RADIUS Configuration: 
Share a basic configuration example for a RADIUS server.
Troubleshooting: Describe a common network issue and how you would use your skills to diagnose and resolve it.
By combining these skills and providing concrete examples, you can effectively explain the process of configuring routers with RADIUS authentication.
